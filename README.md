## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
This is a static, client-side application, so there's no traditional database schema. Instead, content is driven by local JSON files. The architecture focuses on content presentation and user flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["User"] --> B["Portfolio Website (index.html)"];
    B -- "Navigation" --> C{"Page Sections"};
    C -- "Home" --> D["Hero/Intro, Skills (from skills.json)"];
    C -- "Projects" --> E["Project Listing (from projects.json)"];
    C -- "Experience" --> F["Work & Education Timeline"];
    D --> G["Animated Background (particles.min.js)"];
    E --> H["Project Details (Dynamic HTML)"];
    F --> I["Experience Details (Dynamic HTML)"];
    C -- "Resume" --> J["Download Resume (resume.pdf)"];
    K[".github/workflows/ci-cd.yml"] --> L["Automated Deployment"];
    L --> B;
```
